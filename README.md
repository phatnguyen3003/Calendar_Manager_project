# Calendar_Manager_project
This is the first time i wrote a project by python.

this project required some outside of the main library:
+customtkinter
+tkcalendar
+Pillow
+icoextract
+pywin32
+pyodbc

You can install it by run this line in terminal: pip install customtkinter tkcalendar Pillow icoextract pywin32 pyodbc
